This is the repository of Andras Szeitz, Ph.D. student in the GSAT program.
This is the project of UBC STAT 545A course between September and October 2023.
This repository contains the completed project Mini Data Analysis Project: Milestone 1.

During this mini data analysis, I worked with a dataset 'cancer_samples'. I selected four cancer parameters, i.e., radius_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean from this group, and aimed to identify an ideal parameter that can be used to follow cancer growth and status.

Cancer tissue growth samples emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be analyzed with analytical chemistry techniques and used them as biomarkers for diagnosis. I proposed that after tumor diagnosis with such analytical test, cancer growth and status can be followed using the measurement of an ideal cancer parameter, such as cancer radius.
I created several histograms, scatter and box plots, and modified tables to determine which of the several cancer parameters can be used to track cancer development.
After all the data analyis, I prpose cancer radius as the ideal cancer parameter to follow cancer growth and status.
